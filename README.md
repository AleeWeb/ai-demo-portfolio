## 🧱 Portfolio Sections

### **1. Multimodal Prompting**

Multimodal prompting uses multiple input formats such as text, images, audio, or documents within a single prompt 
to give AI richer context and clearer instruction than language alone.

I include multimodal prompting to demonstrate my ability to design prompts that unlock stronger comprehension, evaluation, and output quality in multimodal AI systems.

Multimodal prompting enables models to perform cross-modal reasoning, transfer information between media, and produce more accurate analysis and structured results. This mirrors how humans use different senses 
together to understand the world, where each modality (visual, auditory, linguistic, contextual) contributes another layer of meaning.

### **2. Prompt Refinement**
Featured Methods:
- Few-Shot  
- Chain-of-Thought  
- Chain-of-Density  
- Zero-Shot  

Highlights how structured refinement improves clarity, correctness, utility, and reasoning.

### **3. Image Generation**
High-fidelity image prompts tested with:
- Midjourney  
- FLUX.1-dev  
- Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)  
- ChatGPT Image Models  

Evaluated for alignment, detail control, consistency, and prompt-to-output accuracy.

### **4. Video Generation**

- Midjourney Video
- Qwen2-VL Hugging Face Space
