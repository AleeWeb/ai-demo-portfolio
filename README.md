# 🌐 Generative AI Portfolio

A concise collection of **AI prompting, refinement, and multimodal prompting demos**.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates how I:
- Design clear and structured prompts  
- Refine outputs using proven methods  
- Evaluate model behavior across tasks  
- Identify hallucinations, gaps, and inconsistencies  
- Produce repeatable, testable prompt workflows  

All demos are safe. No NDA-protected information is included.

## 🧱 Portfolio Sections

### **1. Multimodal Prompting**

Multimodal prompting uses multiple input formats such as text, images, audio, or documents within a single prompt 
to give AI richer context and clearer instruction than language alone.

I include multimodal prompting to demonstrate my ability to design prompts that unlock stronger comprehension, evaluation, and output quality in multimodal AI systems.

Multimodal prompting enables models to perform cross-modal reasoning, transfer information between media, and produce more accurate analysis and structured results. This mirrors how humans use different senses 
together to understand the world, where each modality (visual, auditory, linguistic, contextual) contributes another layer of meaning.

### **2. Prompt Refinement**

Highlights how structured refinement improves clarity, correctness, utility, and reasoning.

Featured Methods:
- Few-Shot  
- Chain-of-Thought  
- Chain-of-density
- Zero-shot Method

### **3. Image Generation**
High-fidelity image prompts tested with:
- Midjourney  
- FLUX.1-dev (to come soon) 

Evaluated for alignment, detail control, consistency, and prompt-to-output accuracy.

### **4. Video Generation**

- Midjourney Video
- Pika 2.5
